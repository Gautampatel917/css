        justify-content : align item horizontally   (left-right)
            some property : space-between, space-around and many more.

        align-item : align item vertically  (top-bottom)

        flex-direction : control the lay oÆ’ the flex like top-right, column, column reverse, row, row reverse and etc...

        flex-wrap : manage content base on size of container if it's bigger than the space in the container ,it will wrap to next line

        align-content : if you have more than more one line you have to use align-content property rather than align-item.

        row-gap And column-gap : just like name suggest.

        order : give priority of the item more less more priority.

        flex-grow : more you put it higher value more will be take by that element in ratio.
        
        flex-shrink : how much it can shrink if there is not enough place for all elements.
